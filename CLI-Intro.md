# Introduction to the Command Line

**Windows Users** Go to [http://git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com) and download `Git-Bash`. Open it.

**Mac Users** Find `Terminal.app` and open it.

## Navigation

Get to where you can see your Desktop on your computer.

Right-click (two-finger click, control-click) on the Desktop and create a new Folder. Name it "Demo1".

Do that again and create a folder named "Demo2".

In your Terminal, type `cd` and hit the `return` key. `cd` stands for "change directory."

(After every command you type, from now on, hit the `return` key to enter it.)

Type `pwd` ("print working directory"); see what answer you get.

Type `ls` ("list"); see what answer you get.

Type `cd Desktop`. Then do a `pwd` and a `ls`.
