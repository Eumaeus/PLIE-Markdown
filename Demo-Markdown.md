# Markdown Demonstration

In Markdown, you can do simple formatting very easily. You can show *emphasis* like this, and **strong emphasis** like this.

To make a new paragraph, just put an empty line between two lines.

You can break a line wherever you want, without
making a new paragraph. If you like that better.
When you want a new paragraph
just add a blank line. I'll end
this
paragraph
now.

â€¦And start a new one here.

Lists are equally easy. You can make an *unordered* list like this:

- An item
- Another item
- A third item

Ordered lists are equally easy. The one things computers can do well is count:

1. Item A
1. Item B
1. Item C
1. Item D

You can make a link to a webpage very easily. Here is a link to [Furman's webpage](http://www.furman.edu).
